## Introduction
Welcome to my e-commerce website project, a clone of Amazon! This is my first major project after learning HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate the basic layout and design of Amazon's homepage. 

**Note:** This project is still a work in progress and is not fully responsive yet.

## Features
- **Homepage Layout:** Mimics the basic structure and style of Amazon's homepage.
- **Product Listings:** Displays a selection of products with images, titles, and prices.
- **Navigation Bar:** Includes links to different sections similar to Amazon.
- **Footer:** Contains useful links and information.
